# Ableton Pratice

This project is a recreation of the [Ableton] home page (https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/ableton) without looking at the source code.

All my work for this will be documented here and shared online, mostly on my twitter account throughout the implementation of this web page.

**This is not in any way any kind of form trying to steal others work or whatever. There are no commercial interest in this. This is purely for practice and showcasing my skills as a front end developer.**

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
